## M2 Milestone: First Simulated Trade ✅

### Summary
- Tuned strategy from conservative (EMA 9/21, RSI 14) to aggressive v3 (EMA 5/13, RSI 10)
- Added momentum and EMA-spread signals to generate trades even in low-volatility periods
- Successfully opened first simulated trade

### Parameter Changes
| Parameter | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| EMA fast/slow | 9/21 | 5/13 |
| RSI period | 14 | 10 |
| RSI overbought/oversold | 78/22 | 65/35 |
| Momentum threshold | N/A | ±0.3% |
| EMA spread threshold | N/A | ±0.05% |

### Trade #1
- **07:12 UTC** — OPEN LONG 0.073882 BTC @ $67,675.21 (50% of capital = $5,000)
- Signal: EMA spread (0.088%) + RSI 52.9 + UP trend + momentum 0.47%
- Rationale: Multiple weak-but-aligned bullish signals triggered the spread rule

### Observations
- BTC in a mild uptrend over the past 7 days
- RSI near neutral (52-53), not strongly directional
- Strategy now fires on trend alignment even without crossover events
- Need to monitor: with lower thresholds, whipsaw risk increases

### Next Steps
- Run sim-trader periodically (background cron or heartbeat-triggered)
- Monitor position for SL/TP hits
- After accumulating 5-10 trades, evaluate win rate and adjust
